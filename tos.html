  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-11</p>

  <p>
    This document describes the terms of service for the "TikTok Auto Uploader"
    desktop tool ("the Tool").
  </p>

  <h2>1. Purpose of the Tool</h2>
  <p>
    The Tool is a personal automation script that uploads images and videos
    from a local folder to my own TikTok account using the TikTok API.
    It is used only by me, the developer, and is not offered to the public.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No Third-Party Users</h2>
  <p>
    The Tool is not provided as a commercial service and is not intended
    for use by any third parties. No other users can sign up or access it.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Sources</h2>
  <p>
    The Tool only accesses media files that I store locally on my own computer
    and metadata that I define (e.g. captions). It does not collect data from
    other users.
  </p>

  <h2>4. TikTok Terms</h2>
  <p>
    The Tool uses the official TikTok API and is subject to TikTok's own terms,
    policies and rate limits. If TikTok changes or revokes API access,
    the Tool may stop working.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    The Tool is provided "as is" without any guarantees. I am solely responsible
    for how it is used with my own TikTok account.
  </p>
