  <h1>TikTok Auto Uploader</h1>
  <p>
    This is a personal desktop tool that runs locally on my own computer.
    It automatically uploads images and videos from a local folder to my
    TikTok account, using the official TikTok API.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tool is not sold, not distributed and has only one user: me, the developer.
    It does not provide any functionality to third parties.
