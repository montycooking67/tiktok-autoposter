<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-11</p>

  <h2>1. Scope</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how the "TikTok Auto Uploader" desktop tool
    ("the Tool") handles data. The Tool is used only by me, the developer,
    on my own computer.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Personal Data</h2>
  <p>
    The Tool does not collect personal data from third-party users.
    It only processes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Media files (images and videos) stored locally on my own device</li>
    <li>Captions and metadata that I manually define</li>
    <li>Authentication tokens for my own TikTok account, stored locally in configuration files or environment variables</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    All configuration files and media files are stored locally on my own
    computer or backup devices under my control. No data is stored on
    servers that belong to this Tool.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    The Tool sends media files and captions to TikTok via the official API
    for the purpose of publishing posts on my TikTok account.
    Apart from TikTok, no other third parties receive any data.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    API keys and access tokens are stored in local configuration files
    or environment variables. I take reasonable steps to keep my device secure
    (for example using passwords and up-to-date software).
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes</h2>
  <p>
    I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will update
    the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
